            <h4 class="education">Education</h4>
            <p>I attended the Konoha's academy for Ninja since I was 3 years old. It was always my dream to become the strongest shinobi so that the whole village would recognize me and respect me.</p>

            <h4 class="job">Job Experience</h4>
            <p>I have been a shinobi for almost 4 years. I enjoy being a shinobi. I am one of the strongest shinobi in the land. I have multiple jutsu in my command.</p>
